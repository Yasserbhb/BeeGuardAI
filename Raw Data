Here is the Google Drive link containing several video recordings captured in autumn 2025 in front of active beehives during yellow-legged hornet activity. 
The dataset includes sequences with and without bees, as well as multiple attack situations where several hornets hover and hunt in front of the hive entrance. 
These recordings were used for labeling, training, and testing our detection models.
