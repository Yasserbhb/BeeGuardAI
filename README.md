🐝 BeeGuardAI — Project Story

Since its accidental introduction in France around 2004, the yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina nigrithorax) has spread explosively across Europe. With no natural predators, this invasive species has become a major threat to biodiversity. It preys on pollinators—especially honeybees—and has developed a remarkably effective hunting strategy: hovering in front of hives, ambushing bees as they leave, and frightening the entire colony into staying inside. This pressure occurs at the end of summer and in autumn, the critical period when bees must build their winter reserves. As a result, thousands of colonies collapse each year, and many do not survive winter.

At the moment, beekeepers have no reliable, scalable solution. The hornet population keeps growing, endangering bees, other pollinators, ecosystems, and even humans—its nests are difficult to spot, and accidental encounters have already caused fatal attacks.

At Sorbonne University and Polytech Sorbonne, we have been working for several years on hive-monitoring projects with embedded systems and IoT technologies. This year, as part of a new initiative launched alongside the Edge Impulse hackathon, we created BeeGuardAI to focus specifically on the yellow-legged hornet: detecting it, counting it, and alerting beekeepers in real time. The project was started jointly by a group of Sorbonne University students and their supervising instructor, Yann Douze (professor of Embedded Systems, IoT, Processor Architecture, and Chip Design), together with a team of motivated participants. The hackathon provided the ideal framework to kick-start this new effort, experiment rapidly, and build the first AI-powered prototypes.

The idea is simple:
A low-cost embedded device placed on top of a hive monitors the flight area with a small camera. Using Edge Impulse tools, we collected and labeled videos, experimented with AI-assisted annotation, trained recognition models, and deployed them on embedded hardware. The system counts hornets, alerts beekeepers, estimates threat levels, and provides actionable data—whether to move hives, destroy nearby nests, or reinforce protection.

The project roadmap includes a second phase: active defense mechanisms, such as mechanical sweeping arms or other deterrents, to push hornets away and allow bees to keep working safely. Long-term, BeeGuardAI aims to become a citizen-science network, enabling beekeepers to install inexpensive units and contribute to a unified platform that maps hornet presence across regions. This would support ecological monitoring, early-warning alerts, research efforts, and public-policy planning.

BeeGuardAI is a small step toward addressing a large ecological crisis—with edge AI, community participation, and practical, field-ready tools to help protect pollinators and the ecosystems that depend on them.
